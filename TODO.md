# TODO

## Mousetrap based keyboard events
- [ ] Mousetrap to register all key combos
    - [ ] Move utility functions to elmoed
    - [ ] Add `.bind` functionality to elmoed, that hooks in Mousetrap on
        front-end with backend
    - [ ] Add auto-unbind on editor unmount (?)
    - [ ] Add editor "focus" concept (?) - this replaces some of the
        boilerplate-y code and allows focus-follows mouse or last click or
        whatever, and may eventually work its way into Scroll
